Visual Localization

 Camera images are easiest types and so they're cheap ! But precise location from images is hard. In practise they can be
combines from other sensors to accurately localize the vehicle.

 3DMap and Image match !

 There is a example scenario which contains the car and tree. There can be a tree in everywhere but we are interested in 
which trees are on our right side. So collecting like theese informations, we can precise our location. (Observations) This
process called particle filter.

 Advantage of visual localization is image data is easy to obtain. Disadvantage point is lack of 3d infos.
