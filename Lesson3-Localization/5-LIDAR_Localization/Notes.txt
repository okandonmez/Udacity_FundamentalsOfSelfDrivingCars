Lidar Localization

 With lidar, we can localize a car by means of point cloud matching. This method continously matches the detected data from
lidar sensors with the preexisting high definition map. Complete position and heading of the car. There are many algorithms
for matching the points. 

 One of the is Iterative Closest Point or ICP.

 We can make the comparison between sensor scan and global map. Result of this comparison we can calculate our location.

 Filter algorithms are another approach. They're removes redundant information and find the most likely position of the vehicle
on the map. Apollo uses HISTOGRAM FILTER.

 This approach is uses the Sum Of Squeare Differences or SSD.(That equation in dir)


 KALMAN FILTERS are another approach to LIDAR localization. 
Based on our current state based on our past state in new sensor measurement. Kalman Filters use a prediction update cycle. 

All of them can be changed in next time !!!
