Inertial Navigation

1st Video
---------------------------------------------------
 Imagine a car travelling in a straight line at constant velocity. If i gave the initial position of the car, after t time we can calculate the position of car. 

 Same problem without initial position, we have the initial speed and velocity. We can tell the velocity of car after t time. 

  v = v0 + at

 This just raises another question: How can we measure the acceleration ? 

	- Accelerator
	- Gyroscope

 the main components of an Inertial Measurement Unit -> IMU (can reach 1000Hz) We can trust the Imu for localization over a very short time horizon. So we can combine 
the IMU and GPS.
