LiDAR Images

 Some parameters like distances are diffucult to obtain from cameras. LiDAR sensors uses laser for depth calculations.
After reflection of laser, LiDAR measures to time. 

 Data it collects forms a cloud of points or point cloud. Each point in the point cloud represents a laser beam that bounces
back to the sensor. These point clouds can tell us a lot of things avout object such as shape surface texture.
