Backpropagation

Training process is contain 3 steps

 - Feed Forward : We start by randomizing initial weights. Then we feed each image through the neural network to generate
an output value.
 - Error M. : Difference between ground truth label
 - Backpropagation We send the error rate to neurons like feed forward process but in reverse.  

 Result of all individual is for more accurate.
