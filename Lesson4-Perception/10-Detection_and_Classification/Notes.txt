Detection and classification

When we talked about the detection, usually firsty thinks the obstacles. 

Static objects walls, trees even buildings
Dynmaic objects pedestrians, cars bicycles.

Computer first needs to know where these objects are located and then classify them. 

Important point is that:

 If the obstacle is bicycle, car may want to change lane and safely pass the bicycle
 but if the obstacle is car, car may dont want to change lane. Keep the distance between car 
and safely travel on same lane. 

 Another example is traffic ligh detection and classification.   

 What algorithms do we use in obstacle detection and classification ?

 - First we use a detection CNN to find the location of objects within the image.   

 Two approach can be apply
 1) Detect, localize in one CNN and pass to data for classifaction to another CNN
 2) Do detection and classification using a single CNN architecture

YOLO and SSD with similar forms.
