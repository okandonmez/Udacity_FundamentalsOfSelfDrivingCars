Machine Learning

 Machine Learning is a special algorithms to train computers to learn from data. We talked about the models and there
are many types of models.

 A model is tool that we can make a prediction about a new object. 
 Machine Learning was born in 1960s but get accelearation on the last 20 years. So its dependent on the 
hardware improvements. 

  He's talking about application areas of ML.

  Supervised Learning: I might show the images with label. Because the model is taking advantage of ground truth 
labels created by humans. 

  Unsupervised Learning: We would let the computer decide on its own which images are similar and which are different

  Semisupervised Learning: Learning combines characteristics of supervised and unsupervised learning. Small amount of 
labeled data and large amount of unlabelled data. 

  Reinforcement Learning: Another type of Machine Learning. Reinf learning allows a model to try many different approaches
to solve a problem and then measures which approach is most succesful. Computer attempts many different solution and 
ultimately adapts its approach to enviroment. (Reward !)
