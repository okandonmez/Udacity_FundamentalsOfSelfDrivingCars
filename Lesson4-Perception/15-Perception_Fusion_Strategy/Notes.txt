Perception Fusion Strategy

 Apollo obstacle detection uses both lidar and radar. The main algorithm for fusin their 
output is the Kalman Filter. 

 A Kalman Filter has 2 steps:
 - First step is to predict state. 
 - Second step is to update measurements. 

 Imagine tracking the pedestrians, the state here includes the position and speed of the 
pedestrian. We start with what we already know about the pedestrian state. We use that info
to perform the first step of the Kalman Filter. Which is the predict the future state of the 
pedestrian. 

 Next step: We use new sensor measurements to update our belief about the state of the pedestrian.
Kalman Filter algorithm is an endless loop of prediction and update steps. 

 2 approaches for measurement update step
 - Synchronous  : update measurements from different sensors all at the same time.
 - Asynchronous :  update as they arrive
