Segmentation

 Semantic segmentation involves classifying each pixel in the image. 

 Semantic segmentation relies on similar CNN called a Fully Convolutional Network or FCN
The FCN replaces the flat layers at the end of  a traditional CNN architecture with convolutional
layers. Now every layer in the network is a convolutional layer hence the name fully convolutional
network. FCN provides by pixel by pixel output that we can layer on top of our original input image.

 Typical CNN result shape is much smaller than the original input image. For segmentation
our output size must match the size of original image. 

 First part is encoder, second part is decoder.
