Neural Network

Inspired by biological neurons that comprise the human nervous system.  

 Neural Networks are comprised of a large number of neurons. They're responsible for delivering and processing the 
information.

 You may not even know how you know that they're vehicles. We dont always know how they distinct, but they learn a
mathematical model for performing this task. 

  When we see a image how our brains work ? First divide to several parts and then identify features such as wheels.
Windows and colors then our brains use those features for classifcation.   

  But our understand isnt ultimately necessary.
