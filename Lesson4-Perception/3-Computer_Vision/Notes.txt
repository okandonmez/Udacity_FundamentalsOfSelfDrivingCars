Computer Vision

has 4 tasks the perceiving the world

Detection: means finding out where an object is in the enviroment
Classification : determining what exactly the object is
Tracking : means observing objects like other vehicles
semantic segmantation: means matching each pixel in an image with the semantic category ( road car or sky )

He's talking about the classifiers.  

Interesting point : Classifiers can even identify behaviors like whether a person is walking or running.

There're many types of classifiers but they all include a similar series of steps.

Input Data -> Preprocessing    ->  Feature     -> Fit to a Classification Model
		Resizing	     Shape		Determine the Class
		Rotating	     Wheels		
		Color Transf

We need to build models.
