\f0\fs24 \cf0 Ending states for SL Trajectories\
\
We\'92ll perform SL planning based on assumption that the car should steadily align with the central line of the lane. To ensure stability the ending state for the cars heading should align with the center of the lane. \
\
In order to achieve this stabil ending states the first order and second order derivatives of heading and position should be both zero.  This means the vehicle neither moving laterally that\'92s the first order derivative. No accelerating laterally that\'92s the second order derivative. The vehicle is just traveling straight down the lane.  }
