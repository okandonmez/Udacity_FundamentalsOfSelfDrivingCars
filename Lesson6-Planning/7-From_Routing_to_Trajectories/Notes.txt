 The high level map route is only one part of the planning process. We still have to build low-level
trajectories to move along that route. This means dealing with objects like other vehicles or 
pedestrians that aren't part of the map.  

 These traffic scenarios require lower level, higher precision planning. We call this level trajectory
generation.
