 A star is a classic algorithm to handle path finding. We take each cell in this world is a node
we're able to move any on node to any of its adjacent nodes. And particular world has some obstacles
that block potential paths. 

 The computer has to check if any path leads to the goal. The computer could exhaustively try all
the possible paths to find the shortest one. This takes a lot of time especially when the map gets larger.

 8 adjacent cells. These 8's has another 8 adjacent according to map. 

 We need to consider most of the adjacent nodes is candidate. For each of the candidate nodes we consider
2 things. 

 - First we calculate the cost it takes to travel from the start node to that candidate node. 
 - Second we estimate how much it costs to travel from that candidate node to the goal.
