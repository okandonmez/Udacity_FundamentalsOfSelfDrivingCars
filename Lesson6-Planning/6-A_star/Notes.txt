 Now lets consider a map in the real world. Suppose we'd pull up to an intersection. We can go
to the multiple ways. 

 After getting the candidate nodes, we evaluate the our options. From the image, it takes a lot of
cost through the intersection. Assign a higher g value. 

 Go all over highway and exit takes too much and assign it as h value. 
 Sum the h and g values calculate for f value.
