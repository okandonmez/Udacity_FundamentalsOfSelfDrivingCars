## General Information About Repository

 This repo will contains the my lecture notes of Udacity Fundamentals Of Self Driving Car. After finishing that trainee i will write a very detailed summary notes about course for me and whose interested. 

## General Information About Course

Through this course, you will be able to identify key parts of self-driving cars and get to know Apollo architecture. You will be able to utilize Apollo HD Map, localization, perception, prediction, planning and control, and start the learning path of building a self-driving car. [1]
