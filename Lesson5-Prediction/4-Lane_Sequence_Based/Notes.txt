Apollo provides a model-driven approach called Lane Sequence-Based Prediction.

To build lane sequences, we first divide the road into multiple segments.

For prediction purposes, we care more about how the vehicle transitions between these segments,
than how it behaves within the segments. We can group vehicles' behaviors into a limited set of
patterns and describe these patterns as sequences of lane segments.
