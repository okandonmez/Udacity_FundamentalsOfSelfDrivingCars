Predictions

Our car needs to predict the behavior of these other objects so that we're able to make
the best decisions about what our own vehicles should do.

We predict the behavior of an object by generating trajectory for it. Watch the car steer
to the right, and it start to decelerate in front of the ramp.

This is the trajectory we might predict for this car. We make similar predictions for all 
the other objects in our environment.

At each timestep, we recalculate the predictions for every vehicle in the environment.
These predictions inform the decisions our vehicle makes during the planning phase.

objects based on both their state and the location of our own self-driving car.
