Predictions

Prediction needs to be real-time, that means we want the latency to be as small as possible.
so we want to ensure that the next five meters is free of obstacles and safe to traverse 
before we drive into it.

The next goal is accuracy. We want our predictions to be as accurate as possible

The prediction module should also be able to learn new behaviors.Situations become really 
complicated with multiple vehicles on the road.

It's impossible to develop a static model that considers every single scenario.
