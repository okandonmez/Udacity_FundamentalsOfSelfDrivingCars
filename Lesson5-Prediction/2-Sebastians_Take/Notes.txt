Now that you know how to perceive the world using sensors, the next question is 
how to predict it.

The next thing is to predict how the world is going to look in the future and it's 
important because as you plan your path where to go, you want to understand where all 
the other guys are going, the other cars, and bicycles, and pedestrians.

If you don't, you will crash.

So it's all about prediction.

there're two basic types of prediction we're going to look at, one is model-based one is
data-driven. Model-based obviously is more analytic.

So we're going to simplify prediction to make it manageable and it's going to be the core
for decision making
