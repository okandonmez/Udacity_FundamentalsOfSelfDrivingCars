Obstacle Status

To predict the motion of an object, we need to know the state of the object.

When we're driving, as humans, we predict what an object will do by looking at its heading,
position, speed, and acceleration.This is also how an autonomous vehicle observes object's state.


In addition to position, speed, heading, and acceleration, our autonomous vehicle will also 
consider the position of the object inside the lane segment.

The prediction module also incorporate state information from previous timesteps in order to
 make more accurate predictions.
