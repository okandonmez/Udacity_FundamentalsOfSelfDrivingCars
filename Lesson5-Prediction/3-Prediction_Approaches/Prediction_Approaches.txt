Approaches

We'll introduce two different prediction approaches;

 - model-based prediction 
 - data-driven prediction.

Suppose our car pulls up to a T-shaped intersection and sees another 
car approaching from the left. At this moment, we're not yet sure whether that other
 car is going to turn right or go straight.

Using the model-based approach,
we actually construct two candidate predictive models for this scenario.
One model describes the movement of that other vehicle turning right, which we illustrate
 with the green trajectory.The other model describes the movement
 of that vehicle continuing straight, which we illustrate with the blue trajectory. At 
this instant, we think either of those two models is equally likely.

We observe the movement of the moving vehicle
to see if it matches one of those trajectories.
If we were to see the vehicle start to shift lanes to the left,
we would become more confident that
the vehicle was ultimately planning to continue straight.
That's how model-based prediction works.

Data-driven prediction uses machine learning to train a model based on observations.
Once the machine learning model is trained,
we can use it to make predictions in the real world.
The advantage of data-driven prediction is that the more data we add to the training set
the better our model gets.
