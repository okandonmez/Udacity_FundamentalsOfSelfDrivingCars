Trajectory generation is the final step of prediction.


Between any two points, A and B, there are infinite candidate trajectories for an object 
to travel.

How do we predict the most likely trajectory?

First, we make an assumption that the car will align with the center of the target lane.
We continue by discarding trajectories which are impossible to be physically executed by the 
vehicle.

We select from among the remaining trajectories by considering the vehicle's current velocity
and acceleration.

In practice, we don't actually list all of the possible trajectories and eliminate them 
one-by-one. Rather, we apply this idea mathematically.

We can fit a polynomial model using these two conditions. In most cases, this kind of polynomial
model is good enough for prediction.
