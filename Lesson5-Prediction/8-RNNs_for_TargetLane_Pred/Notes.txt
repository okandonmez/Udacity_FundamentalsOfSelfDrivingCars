Apollo uses RNNs to build a model to predict the target lane of a vehicle. Apollo provides one
RNN model for the lane sequences and another RNN model for the associated object states.

Apollo then concatenates the outputs of these two RNNs and feeds them into another neural
network which estimates a probability for each lane sequence.

To train this network, we use existing records. Each record contains a lane sequence, the 
associated object states, and a label indicating whether the object followed this specific 
lane sequence or not. For training, we compare the output of our network and the ground truth
label, and use backpropagation to train the network.
